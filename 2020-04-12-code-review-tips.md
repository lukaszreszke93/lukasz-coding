	### Talk about CODE, not the PERSON
    
    1. Remember to talk about the CODE, not the PERSON
	2. Split your commit into smaller chunks. For example, try to separate pure business change from changing variable name in 100 files.
	3. Think about business problem that the code is solving and look for issues in that context first
	4. Look for code smells like coupling code in bouned context that shouldn't have place
	5. Rember! There's a person on the other side. 
	6. Be explicit with your comments.
	7. Talk about your expectations for code
	8. Use static code analyser to pick up changes that are not compliant with coding conventions that your team uses.
	9. Be polite
	10. The best code review is the one where you don't leave a comment, so don't settle down for finding ANY issue
